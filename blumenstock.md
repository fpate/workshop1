In order to discuss human development, it is important for companies to understand the data they collect and the impact of their information. Companies such as Facebook, Google and Waze use "big data" in order to further understand their consumers. This data refers to information collected from cellphones and satellites regarding personal information and location. Other non-profit organizations such as  GiveDirectly, use this big data to provide money and resources to those in need. Digital maps created by social media platforms and smartphone companies provide information about the world, furthering scientific understanding of poor communities withn developing countries. Although this data is very beneficial to human development, often this information is greatly misused. Throughout Joshua Blumenstock's article, he explains that technology has the power to help but also harm a company's understanding of international development. 
 
While this data has the intention to better the human race, often this information does more harm than good. For example, GiveDirectly is a non-profit organization that helps people in developing countries obtain bank loans. However, there are discrepancies when providing money to the right people in need. GiveDirectly would use satellite maps to give money to communities with thatched roofs. The intention to provide money for those in need was positive, but the outcome was poor. Families would put thatched roofs on their houses in order to obtain the money that did they did not necessarily need. When using data science, it is important to keep track of major discrepancies that will negatively impact the human race rather than improve it. 

Throghout the article, Blumenstock also explains that technology has the power to inform vital information about the public. But, the process of obtaining this information must be transparent. For example, the right to privacy has been a controversial issue over the last decade. As the use of technology continues to increase, questions of  privacy among consumers have been raised. Companies, such as Facebook and Instagram, have gathered information in order to provide the best advertisements according to the user's likes and dislikes. While this data may be important, the collection of this data is a violation of privacy. It is important that companies who collect this data are completely transparent, so that there is mutual trust among consumers and major organizations. 

Although, the large data collected from private accounts also has the power to save a person's life. Blumenstock says that companies can use the same data Facebook uses to pick advertisements to provide food and resources to developing countries. This also refers to the balancing act when discusses human development. Data scientists must understand where the information is coming from and applying it to those in need. As the world enters into a new decade, it is difficult to balance privacy rights with vital information. Companies must understand this in order to truely develop humanity justly and correcly.
